\caption{Latent change score models. (A) Example of a bivariate latent change score model (for details see text); legend to lines: dotted = loadings fixed to zero, red = self-feedback \(\beta\), blue = cross-domain coupling \(\gamma\), grey = correlation \(\phi\) of predictors at T1, green = correlated change \(\rho\); (B) Grade Point Average (GPA) and (C) to (F) subject-specific changes in grades at T2 (indicated by prefix \(\Delta\)) as predicted by their respective T1 levels as well as by Need for Cognition (NFC) and (overall as well as subject specific) Ability Self-Concept (ASC) at T1; coefficients are standardized coefficients.}
