This repository contains the data and code for reproducing the analyses described in the above manuscript. To use it, simply clone the project via the green `Code` button top right. As the project is maintained using the R packages [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) and [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org), you should be able to reproduce all results of the manuscript in an instance ... well, apart from the time it takes to load all the packages used for our analyses when you activate the project via `activate_project.R` located in the root folder.

The project contains the following folders:

- [Code](Code) contains the analysis code of this project
- [Data](Data) contains the aggregated data needed to execute the analysis code and an `*.RData`file with all the variablkes generated by the R script in the `Code` folder
- [Manuscript](Manuscript) contains the R Markdown file of the manuscript for this project and the PDF file generated by this file
- [renv](renv) contains the information on all the R packages used for this project as well as a routine for installing the package versions used to be able to fully reproduce the results of our manuscript even if you have other versions of these packages installed   

To use this project, simply clone this project, open `activate_course.R` in the root folder under [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), and then follow the instructions in the comments of `activate_course.R`. Once all package versions have been loaded (which may take a while), execute the script in the Code folder and then you should be able to knit the manuscript from the `*.Rmd`file in the Manuscript folder by hitting the `Knit` button in RStudio (better make a copy of the `*.pdf` file already provided in this folder to your output with ours).

If you have questions on how to use this project, on the code and/or statistical analyses, please do not hesitate to contact [Alexander Strobel](mailto:alsexander.strobel@tu-dresden.de).
