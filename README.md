This repository contains the data and code for reproducing the analyses described in the above manuscript. 

The project contains the following folders:

- [Code](Code) contains the analysis code of this project
- [Data](Data) contains the original data needed to execute the analysis code and `*.RData` files with all the variables generated by the R scripts in the `Code` folder
- [Manuscript](Manuscript) contains files of the main manuscript and supplement as well as their revisions and revision letters, both in *.docx and *.pdf format

To use this project, either clone this project from https://github.com/alex-strobel/NFC-Grades via the green `Code` button top right (recommended) or
download the respective files from https://osf.io/34yav/files/github via the `Download this folder` link at the top right on that page.

To reproduce our result, you need the free [R software for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/). When R is installed, open the R script `NFC-Grades_new.R` in the `Code` folder, and once all missing packages are installed via executing code lines 5-10, you should be able to reproduce the results of our manuscript. Note that because of potential differences in package versions used by *us* for this manuscript (see Supplementary Material/Supplementary Methods for the version numbers used here) and the packages used by *you* to reproduce the results, there might be some minor numerical deviations in the results. If you deem these deviations not so minor, please contact [alexander.strobel@tu-dresden.de](mailto:alexander.strobel@tu-dresden.de).
