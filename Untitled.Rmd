```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Method

We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study.

```{r correlation, echo = F}
set.seed(242)
X = rnorm(64)
Y = .5 * X + rnorm(64)
cor_XY = cor.test(X[-1], Y[-1])
Pval <- function(p) {
  if (p < .001) { pchar = '$p<.001$' } 
  else { pchar = paste0('$p=', format(round(cor_XY$p.value, 3), nsmall = 3), '$') }
  return(pchar)
}

```

# Results

As hypothesized, X was correlated with Y, $r=$ `r format(round(cor_XY$estimate, 2), nsmall = 2)`, $df=$ `r cor_XY$parameter`, `r Pval(cor_XY$p.value)`.
